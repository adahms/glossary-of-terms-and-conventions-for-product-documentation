What kind of terms and conventions does this document describe?::

Are there any reasons a contribution might not be accepted?::

All contributions are welcome, but reviewers might decline contributions that fall under the following:

* Terms or conventions that are considered part of the general sphere of professional writing, such as basic grammar and punctuation.
* Terms or conventions that are already included in _The IBM Style Guide_.

[[two-entries-with-same-ID]]
What if two entries have the same ID?::

When creating IDs in accordance with the rules described in xref:template-for-entries[], the resulting IDs might be the same as those for separate entries. For example, the "kernel space" and "kernel-space" entries, or the "kB" and "KB" entries would have the same anchor tag ("kernel-space" and "kb"). If the IDs are not unique, however, it will cause an error in the document.
+
To avoid this issue, use different IDs:
+
* For entries that have different class, append:
+
** `n` for nouns (`kernel-space-n`)
** `v` for verbs
** `adj` for adjectives (`kernel-space-adj`)
** `adv` for adverbs
** `conj` for conjunctions
** `prep` for prepositions
+
* For different entries with the same name, for example a command and a program or a programming language of the same name, append `command` to the command ID, for example `ceph-command`.
+
* For entries that differ in spelling, for example "kB" and "KB", preserve the letter case.
+
Raise an issue if in doubt. See xref:submitting-issues[] for details.
